```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(rgdal)
library(geojsonio)
```

```{r}
# I have yet to get the rgdal solution to work. 
# hawaii <- readOGR(dsn = "./Hawaii.geojson", layer = "OGRGeoJSON")
hawaii <- geojson_read("Hawaii.geojson", what = "sp")
```

Looks like the projection is there so all I should have to do is simply write the shapefile
```{r}
hawaii@proj4string
writeOGR(hawaii, "./hawaii_shp","hawaii_shp", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")
```
